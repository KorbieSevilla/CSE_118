Rent-A-Driveway

  What we look to achieve is to make parking a more convenient and time efficient process. In doing so, we are solving several problems. For instance, we are decreasing CO2 emissions, decrease time spent in traffic, assist students/people living in cars by offering them a safe place to stay at night. 
	Rent-A-Driveway (R.A.D) is an application that will connect people with vehicles to people with open driveway spaces. On our app, you will be able to look for spots as a driver or post your available spots as a renter. The rates for spaces would be determined by our analysis of the number of spots in the area as well as what renters would accept.
